## Inspiration

We created XR Cupid to help people who face challenges with dating, especially those who experience social anxiety or are neurodivergent. Millions of singles fall into this category, yet existing dating apps fail to provide the guidance they need. Hiring a dating coach isn't always an option either—whether due to discomfort or financial constraints.

That's where our app comes in. XR Cupid acts as a personalized AI dating coach. From the start, we take the time to understand each user's personality through a series of thoughtful questions. Because everyone is unique, we don’t believe in one-size-fits-all advice. Instead, we use a personality-based approach, inspired by methods from personality analysis tests, to tailor the experience to each individual.

At XR Cupid, we believe everyone deserves love! Our mission is to give people the tools and support they need to create meaningful connections and experience the best dates of their lives.

## What it does
Our app is designed to truly understand each user's personality and provide a personalized dating coaching experience. We’ve created multiple AI romance coaches, each specializing in different personality types, so users can connect with the one that suits them best. These AI romance coaches-Grace, Rizzo, and Posie- aren’t just guides—they’re conversational partners who help users navigate every step of their dating journey.

To make the experience even more impactful, we track important metrics like eye contact, body movements, and posture, offering real-time feedback to help users build confidence and refine their approach. Plus, our feedback system lets users check back in with their romance coach after a date to get thoughtful follow-ups and advice for the next step. It’s all about helping people feel supported and prepared to make meaningful connections.

## How we built it
We built XR Cupid using the Meta Quest 3, tapping into the powerful Meta SDK to bring our vision to life. To create our AI avatar and large language model, we utilized Convai, combining their technology with our own creativity. We pushed the limits of the SDK to make the app as interactive and engaging as possible, ensuring users feel truly immersed in the experience.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges we faced was gathering valuable data and integrating an AI language model with a live 3D character. Since there aren’t many resources available about the dating experiences of neurodivergent individuals, we had to conduct extensive research to ensure our project truly met their needs. It was a learning process, but one we embraced wholeheartedly to create something meaningful.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re incredibly proud of bringing our app to life and getting it fully up and running. What means the most to us is being able to reach and support audiences that are often underrecognized. We put a lot of effort into market research to validate our idea, and we’re equally proud of the diversity within our team—each member brought unique perspectives and talents that were instrumental in building this project. It’s been a journey, and we’re excited about what we’ve accomplished together.

## What we learned
Participating in the Founders Lab has been an incredible experience where we’ve learned so much about pitching a business. Developing that skill throughout this hackathon has been invaluable for our team. We also gained a deeper understanding of using the Cognitive 3D platform to analyze user metrics, which was a fascinating challenge. But more than anything, we learned how to communicate and collaborate more effectively as a team. Along the way, we not only created something amazing but also formed lifelong friendships!

## What's next for XR Cupid
Our next step is to fully implement the tracking system and provide users with real-time scoring feedback to enhance their experience. We also plan to bring our app to the Meta Quest Store, making it accessible to more people. Additionally, we’re excited to develop our own custom AI model, collaborating with psychologists to ensure we create the most effective and accurate AI and scoring system possible. We’re committed to making our app the best it can be!

## Design System
We created a strong branding and design system to make this project truly unique and special. A powerful brand identity is essential for establishing an impactful and lasting impression, and we’re proud of the thought and creativity that went into making it stand out.
